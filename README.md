=============
The goal here to create a sample product we can put on statvisions.com. We also want to use it as a demo of our Tableau skills but also use it as a revenue tool.

To do
=============
1. add price and weight
2. add a netbook
3. add a chromebook
4. add a smartwatch
5. add a Sony Vaio laptop
6. add a microsoft surface tablet
7. add a samsung all in one desktop
8. change desktop to all-in-one computer, or whatever the prevailing term is

Recommendations
=============
1. I would use Amazon or Bestbuy. It's probably better to use Amazon since we can make money from linking to their products.
2. Make sure to try to keep fields consistent.
